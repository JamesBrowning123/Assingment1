  <p> James Browning Student No 13345136 </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The website is intended to promote beach volleyball as a family activity while appealing to a younger audience of between 15 and 30 years. Other social activities which are offered need to be highlighted such as a licensed bar and a capability for organising functions. The goal of the website is to increase the customer base of Slammers Beach Volleyball by 50%.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> An increase of the number of players at Slammers Beach Volleyball by 50% while appealing to people aged between 15 and 30 years would show the website has served its purpose. A 50% improvement equates to an additional 50 players per week. All the additional 50 players is to fall into the age bracket 15 and 30 years. Lastly, a 25% increase of revenue from the bar takings will show that the website has successfully promoted this aspect of Slammers.</p>
