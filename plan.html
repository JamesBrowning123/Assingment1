  <h1> Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Slammers Beach Volleyball</h1>
	<p> James Browning Student No 13345136 </p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
	<p>To encourage people to sign up to Slammers Beach Volleyball.</p> 
	<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
	<p>The website is intended to promote beach volleyball as a family activity while getting younger players of between 15 and 30 years to play the game. Other social activities which are offered require promotion such as a licensed bar and a capability for organising functions. The goal of the website is to increase the customer base of Slammers Beach Volleyball by 50%.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
	<p> An increase of the number of players at Slammers Beach Volleyball by 50% while getting more people aged between 15 and 30 years to play would demonstrate the website has served its purpose. A 50% improvement equates to an additional 50 players per week. All of the additional 50 players is to be between the ages 15 and 30 years. Lastly, a 25% increase of revenue from bar and food takings will demonstrate that the website has successfully promoted this aspect of Slammers.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p> The site is intended for:
	<p>1.	Families interested in playing sport.</p>
	<p>2.	People aged between 15 and 30 who are interested in team sport.</p>
	<p>3.	People who are looking for a place to socialise.</p>

	<p> The site design will make provisions for the above groups by:
	<p>1.	Using quality images of families and people within the target age group playing volleyball.</p>
	<p>2.	Having an underlying theme of having fun, being happy, socailising, meeting new friends and playing team sport.</p>
	<p>3.	Ensuring there is cohesion with good navigation while using scannable text.</p>
