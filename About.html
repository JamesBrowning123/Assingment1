				<p><b>Playing Guidelines</b></p>
				<p>Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net. The sport originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the U.S. that it has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation sports. There are 800 million players worldwide who play Volleyball at least once a week.</p> 

				<p><b>The object of the game is:</b></p>
					<Blockquote><li>For each team to send the ball regularly over the net to ground it on the opponent's court and to prevent the <li>ball from being grounded on its own court. </li>
					<li>The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court. </li>
					<li>A team is allowed to hit the ball three times (in addition to the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court. A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block. The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes "out" or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault.</li>
					<li>The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise. </li>
					<li>The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). </li>
					<li>If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).</li></blockquote>
